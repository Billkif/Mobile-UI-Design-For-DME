# Mobile-UI-Design-For-DME

This repo will serve to commit the Mobile UI designs from Adobe Xd

# Desicription

Based on the task given by DME systems, this project constitutes replicating a UI design as seen [Here](https://dribbble.com/shots/18306240-SmilePay-Mobile-App-Version)
This Design is a UI interface for a mobile Application based on Fintech transactions. It offers the end user a soft and appealing UI while giving him the possibility
of carrying out various financial transactions and check his statitics in realtime or in a particular time frame.

# Use Cases

This UI could be used for the mobile development of a client side mobile banking or mobile financial(FIAT) lifestyle application

## Financial Planning View

* The first design view shows the financial plans of the user. Here the user sets a goal to be achieved which will intend either a cash inflow operation or cash outflow operation. 
* For example in this case the user sets a goal of buying a house at a particular cost and withing a targeted date. Then he starts saving to that effect and the more he saves for this objective the percentage completion increases and is shown on the loading bar. 
* The next component shows a history of his transactions, either savings or withdrawals indicated by the transaction icons and the color and sign on the amount, within a time frame of a week. 
* The last component shows a button indicating a possibility to make a new savings transaction.

## Dashboard View

* The second design view shows the dashboard. Here the user mainly sees his balance, weekly traffic which can be analyzing total cash inflow vs cash outflow, with the red or negative traffic indicating a negative cash flow for that week.
* The top header shows the user profile with the user details and on the right the notifications icon, where a red dot on top of the bell indicates a new notification.
* There is also the component view at the buttom showing recent transactions.
* Not forgeting the user's vitual credit card with its details at the top.

## Transactions View

* The Third design view shows a statistical view of the users transaction; an analytics chart illustrating transactions in dollars on different days of the month. This chart can be adjusted for different timeframes. 
* This view also gives the possibility of view all the various details of each groups of transactions, with each group of transaction selected via the dropdown. In this view case it is the expenses.

# Critics to Design

Though being a really cool design, i couldn't help but notice some inconsistencies and other aspects which could be added to make the design more practical

## Lack of a Menu view

* Almost every mobile application has a menu view or at least a possibility to seemlessly navigate from one view to the other, but all these three designs dont. My suggestion is to put a horizonatal meny tab at the buttom of the views or at least the main view which would be the dashboard view.

## Better descriptions on components

* The List of transactions are not really explicit. In as much as each transaction shows the title of the transaction, the date and the the amount colored in green or red and a plus or minus sign indicating if its a debit or credit transaction, the transactions don't give details like reason or purpose for the transaction. My suggestion would be to add a small state just after the title of the transation indicating the purpose, for example on the dashboard view, on the transaction list, adobe photoshop debit transaction should have a description like "software purchase", For the Antonsen transaction "money credited", etc.
* The money balances are not descriptive enough, one cannot exactly know what a particular balance is for, is it the total balance the user has or is it a balance set for a paticular project plan as show in the planning view. My suggestion is to add some little description on each balance declared.

## Color Theme
* The color theme for this UI looks great, but for a financial app, i would want to mix things up with a lighter shade of green and gold color pallet, or take on a journey of purple and light/sky blue mix.
